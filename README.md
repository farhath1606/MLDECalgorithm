# MLDECalgorithm
Designed and implemented a custom encryption–decryption model that integrates both classical and modern cryptographic techniques for enhanced data security.

Developed a multi-layered encryption pipeline combining Caesar Shift, XOR masking with SHA-256 keystream, S-Box substitution, matrix transposition, PKCS#7 padding, and AES-256 in CBC mode.

Built a Python-based GUI application (Tkinter) for real-time encryption and decryption of messages using a user-provided passphrase.

Implemented Base64 encoding for safe storage and transmission of ciphertext.

Produced detailed flowcharts and methodology to illustrate the transformation steps, ensuring clarity of design and reversibility.

Evaluated the algorithm’s strengths and limitations by comparing against AES and DES, highlighting academic use cases and layered security benefits.
